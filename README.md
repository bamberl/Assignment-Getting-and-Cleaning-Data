For each measurement it is provided:

- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- An activity code
- A description of the activity code. 
- A subset of 79 measurements of the mean or standard deviations derived from the smartphone readings. The readings are summarised as an average for each activity performed by the subject. 


The dataset includes the following files

- 'README.md'
- 'summariseddata.csv': 79 measurements derived from the smartphone readings. Summarised as an average for each activity performed by the subject.
- 'runanalysis.rmd": An R markdown file that contains the script used to transform the raw data into the tidy data set.
- 'CodeBook.doc. : A codebook describing the variables, a description of the variables, the length of the vaariables and the possible values.
